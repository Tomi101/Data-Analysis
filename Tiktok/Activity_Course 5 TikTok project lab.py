# You are a data professional at TikTok. The data team is working towards building a machine learning model that can be used to determine whether a video contains a claim or whether it offers an opinion. With a successful prediction model, TikTok can reduce the backlog of user reports and prioritize them more efficiently.
# 
# The team is getting closer to completing the project, having completed an initial plan of action, initial Python coding work, EDA, and hypothesis testing.
# 
# The TikTok team has reviewed the results of the hypothesis testing. TikTokâ€™s Operations Lead, Maika Abadi, is interested in how different variables are associated with whether a user is verified. Earlier, the data team observed that if a user is verified, they are much more likely to post opinions. Now, the data team has decided to explore how to predict verified status to help them understand how video characteristics relate to verified users. Therefore, you have been asked to conduct a logistic regression using verified status as the outcome variable. The results may be used to inform the final model related to predicting whether a video is a claim vs an opinion.
# 
# A notebook was structured and prepared to help you in this project. Please complete the following questions.

# # **Course 5 End-of-course project: Regression modeling**
# In this activity, you will build a logistic regression model in Python. As you have learned, logistic regression helps you estimate the probability of an outcome. For data science professionals, this is a useful skill because it allows you to consider more than one variable against the variable you're measuring against. This opens the door for much more thorough and flexible analysis to be completed.
# **The purpose** of this project is to demostrate knowledge of EDA and regression models.
# 
# **The goal** is to build a logistic regression model and evaluate the model.
# *This activity has three parts:*
# 
# **Part 1:** EDA & Checking Model Assumptions
# * What are some purposes of EDA before constructing a logistic regression model?
# 
# **Part 2:** Model Building and Evaluation
# * What resources do you find yourself using as you complete this stage?
# 
# **Part 3:** Interpreting Model Results
# 
# * What key insights emerged from your model(s)?
# 
# * What business recommendations do you propose based on the models built?
# 
# Follow the instructions and answer the question below to complete the activity. Then, you will complete an executive summary using the questions listed on the PACE Strategy Document.
# 
# Be sure to complete this activity before moving on. The next course item will provide you with a completed exemplar to compare to your own work.

data["verified_status"].value_counts(normalize=True)

# Approximately 94.2% of the dataset represents videos posted by unverified accounts and 5.8% represents videos posted by verified accounts. So the outcome variable is not very balanced.

# In[29]:

# Identify data points from majority and minority classes
data_majority = data[data["verified_status"] == "not verified"]

# In[31]:

data_upsampled["text_length"] = data_upsampled["video_transcription_text"].apply(func=lambda text: len(text))

# In[32]:
# Display first few rows of dataframe after adding new column
data_upsampled.head()

# ### **Task 2b. Examine correlations**
# Next, code a correlation matrix to help determine most correlated variables.

# In[34]:
# Code a correlation matrix to help determine most correlated variables
data_upsampled.corr(numeric_only=True)

# In[35]:
# Create a heatmap to visualize how correlated variables are
plt.figure(figsize=(8, 6))
sns.heatmap(
    data_upsampled[["video_duration_sec", "claim_status", "author_ban_status", "video_view_count", 
                    "video_like_count", "video_share_count", "video_download_count", "video_comment_count", "text_length"]]
    .corr(numeric_only=True), 
    annot=True, 
    cmap="crest")
plt.title("Heatmap of the dataset")
plt.show()

# One of the model assumptions for logistic regression is no severe multicollinearity among the features. Take this into consideration as you examine the heatmap and choose which features to proceed with.
# 
# **Question:** What variables are shown to be correlated in the heatmap?
# 
# The above heatmap shows that the following pair of variables are strongly correlated: `video_view_count` and `video_like_count` (0.86 correlation coefficient).
# 
# One of the model assumptions for logistic regression is no severe multicollinearity among the features. To build a logistic regression model that meets this assumption, you could exclude `video_like_count`. And among the variables that quantify video metrics, you could keep `video_view_count`, `video_share_count`, `video_download_count`, and `video_comment_count` as features.

# ## **PACE: Construct**
# 
# After analysis and deriving variables with close relationships, it is time to begin constructing the model. Consider the questions in your PACE Strategy Document to reflect on the Construct stage.

# ### **Task 3a. Select variables**
# Set your Y and X variables.

# In[104]:
# Select outcome variable
y = data_upsampled["verified_status"]

# In[105]:
# Select features
X = data_upsampled[["video_duration_sec", "claim_status", "author_ban_status", "video_view_count", "video_share_count", "video_download_count", "video_comment_count"]]

# Display first few rows of features dataframe
X.head()

# ### **Task 3b. Train-test split**

# Split the data into training and testing sets.
# The `#` and `video_id` columns are not selected as features here, because they do not seem to be helpful for predicting whether a video presents a claim or an opinion. Also, `video_like_count` is not selected as a feature here, because it is strongly correlated with other features, as discussed earlier. And logistic regression has a no multicollinearity model assumption that needs to be met.

# In[106]:
# Split the data into training and testing sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.25, random_state=0)

# Confirm that the dimensions of the training and testing sets are in alignment.

# In[107]:
# Get shape of each training and testing set
X_train.shape, X_test.shape, y_train.shape, y_test.shape

# - The number of features (`7`) aligns between the training and testing sets.
# - The number of rows aligns between the features and the outcome variable for training (`26826`) and testing (`8942`).

# ### **Task 3c. Encode variables**

# In[108]:
# Check the data types of the features.
X_train.dtypes

# In[109]:
# Get unique values in `claim_status`
X_train["claim_status"].unique()

# In[110]:
# Get unique values in `author_ban_status`
X_train["author_ban_status"].unique()

# As shown above, the `claim_status` and `author_ban_status` features are each of data type `object` currently. In order to work with the implementations of models through `sklearn`, these categorical features will need to be made numeric. One way to do this is through one-hot encoding.
# 
# Encode categorical features in the training set using an appropriate method.

# In[111]:
# Select the training features that needs to be encoded
X_train_to_encode = X_train[["claim_status", "author_ban_status"]]

# Display first few rows
X_train_to_encode.head()

# In[112]:
# Set up an encoder for one-hot encoding the categorical features
X_encoder = OneHotEncoder(drop='first', sparse_output=False)

# In[113]:
# Fit and transform the training features using the encoder
X_train_encoded = X_encoder.fit_transform(X_train_to_encode)

X_train_encoded_df = pd.DataFrame(data=X_train_encoded, columns=X_encoder.get_feature_names_out())

# Display first few rows
X_train_encoded_df.head()


# In[117]:
# Display first few rows of `X_train` with `claim_status` and `author_ban_status` columns dropped (since these features are being transformed to numeric)
X_train.drop(columns=["claim_status", "author_ban_status"]).head()


# In[118]:
# Concatenate `X_train` and `X_train_encoded_df` to form the final dataframe for training data (`X_train_final`)
# Note: Using `.reset_index(drop=True)` to reset the index in X_train after dropping `claim_status` and `author_ban_status`,
# so that the indices align with those in `X_train_encoded_df` and `count_df`
X_train_final = pd.concat([X_train.drop(columns=["claim_status", "author_ban_status"]).reset_index(drop=True), X_train_encoded_df], axis=1)

# Display first few rows
X_train_final.head()

# Check the data type of the outcome variable.

# In[119]:
# Check data type of outcome variable
y_train.dtype

# In[120]:
# Get unique values of outcome variable
y_train.unique()

# A shown above, the outcome variable is of data type `object` currently. One-hot encoding can be used to make this variable numeric.
# 
# Encode categorical values of the outcome variable the training set using an appropriate method.

# In[122]:
# Set up an encoder for one-hot encoding the categorical outcome variable
y_encoder = OneHotEncoder(drop='first', sparse_output=False)

# In[123]:
# Encode the training outcome variable
# Notes:
#   - Adjusting the shape of `y_train` before passing into `.fit_transform()`, since it takes in 2D array
#   - Using `.ravel()` to flatten the array returned by `.fit_transform()`, so that it can be used later to train the model
y_train_final = y_encoder.fit_transform(y_train.values.reshape(-1, 1)).ravel()

# Display the encoded training outcome variable
y_train_final

# ### **Task 3d. Model building**

# Construct a model and fit it to the training set.

# In[124]:
# Construct a logistic regression model and fit it to the training set
log_clf = LogisticRegression(random_state=0, max_iter=800).fit(X_train_final, y_train_final)

# ## **PACE: Execute**
# 
# Consider the questions in your PACE Strategy Document to reflect on the Execute stage.

# ### **Taks 4a. Results and evaluation**
# 
# Evaluate your model.

# Encode categorical features in the testing set using an appropriate method.

# In[126]:
# Select the testing features that needs to be encoded
X_test_to_encode = X_test[["claim_status", "author_ban_status"]]

# Display first few rows
X_test_to_encode.head()

# In[127]:
# Transform the testing features using the encoder

# Display first few rows
X_test_encoded_df.head()

# In[129]:
# Display first few rows of `X_test` with `claim_status` and `author_ban_status` columns dropped (since these features are being transformed to numeric)
X_test.drop(columns=["claim_status", "author_ban_status"]).head()

# In[130]:
# Concatenate `X_test` and `X_test_encoded_df` to form the final dataframe for training data (`X_test_final`)
# Note: Using `.reset_index(drop=True)` to reset the index in X_test after dropping `claim_status`, and `author_ban_status`,
# so that the indices align with those in `X_test_encoded_df` and `test_count_df`
X_test_final = pd.concat([X_test.drop(columns=["claim_status", "author_ban_status"]).reset_index(drop=True), X_test_encoded_df], axis=1)

# Display first few rows
X_test_final.head()

# Test the logistic regression model. Use the model to make predictions on the encoded testing set.

# In[131]:
# Use the logistic regression model to get predictions on the encoded testing set
y_pred = log_clf.predict(X_test_final)

# In[132]:
# Display the predictions on the encoded testing set
y_pred

# In[133]:
# Display the true labels of the testing set
y_test

# In[134]:
# Encode the true labels of the testing set so it can be compared to the predictions.
# Notes:
#   - Adjusting the shape of `y_test` before passing into `.transform()`, since it takes in 2D array
#   - Using `.ravel()` to flatten the array returned by `.transform()`, so that it can be used later to compare with predictions
y_test_final = y_encoder.transform(y_test.values.reshape(-1, 1)).ravel()

# Display the encoded testing outcome variable
y_test_final

# Confirm again that the dimensions of the training and testing sets are in alignment since additional features were added.

# In[135]:
# Get shape of each training and testing set
X_train_final.shape, y_train_final.shape, X_test_final.shape, y_test_final.shape

# - The number of features (`8`) aligns between the training and testing sets.
# - The number of rows aligns between the features and the outcome variable for training (`26826`) and testing (`8942`).

# ### **Task 4b. Visualize model results**

# Create a confusion matrix to visualize the results of the logistic regression model.

# In[136]:
# Compute values for confusion matrix
log_cm = confusion_matrix(y_test_final, y_pred, labels=log_clf.classes_)

# Create display of confusion matrix
log_disp = ConfusionMatrixDisplay(confusion_matrix=log_cm, display_labels=log_clf.classes_)

# Plot confusion matrix
log_disp.plot()

# Display plot
plt.show()

# In[138]:
(3758+2044) / (3758 + 725 + 2044 + 2415)

# - The upper-left quadrant displays the number of true negatives: the number of videos posted by unverified accounts that the model accurately classified as so.
# 
# - The upper-right quadrant displays the number of false positives: the number of videos posted by unverified accounts that the model misclassified as posted by verified accounts.
# 
# - The lower-left quadrant displays the number of false negatives: the number of videos posted by verified accounts that the model misclassified as posted by unverified accounts.
# 
# - The lower-right quadrant displays the number of true positives: the number of videos posted by verified accounts that the model accurately classified as so.
# 
# - A perfect model would yield all true negatives and true positives, and no false negatives or false positives.

# In[139]:
# Create a classification report that includes precision, recall, f1-score, and accuracy metrics to evaluate the performance of the logistic regression model.
target_labels = ["verified", "not verified"]
print(classification_report(y_test_final, y_pred, target_names=target_labels))

# The classification report above shows that the logistic regression model achieved a precision of 61% and a recall of 84%, and it achieved an accuracy of 65%. Note that the precision and recall scores are taken from the "not verified" row of the output because that is the target class that we are most interested in predicting. The "verified" class has its own precision/recall metrics, and the weighted average represents the combined metrics for both classes of the target variable.

# ### **Task 4c. Interpret model coefficients**

# In[141]:
# Get the feature names from the model and the model coefficients (which represent log-odds ratios)
# Place into a DataFrame for readability
pd.DataFrame(data={"Feature Name":log_clf.feature_names_in_, "Model Coefficient":log_clf.coef_[0]})

# ### **Task 4d. Conclusion**
# 
# 1. What are the key takeaways from this project?
# 
# 2. What results can be presented from this project?

# Key takeaways:
# 
# - The dataset has a few strongly correlated variables, which might lead to multicollinearity issues when fitting a logistic regression model. We decided to drop `video_like_count` from the model building.
# - Based on the logistic regression model, each additional second of the video is associated with 0.009 increase in the log-odds of the user having a verified status.
# - The logistic regression model had not great, but acceptable predictive power: a precision of 61% is less than ideal, but a recall of 84% is very good. Overall accuracy is towards the lower end of what would typically be considered acceptable. 
# 
# 
# We developed a logistic regression model for verified status based on video features. The model had decent predictive power. Based on the estimated model coefficients from the logistic regression, longer videos tend to be associated with higher odds of the user being verified. Other video features have small estimated coefficients in the model, so their association with verified status seems to be small.
